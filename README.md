# Stock Portfolio

> A simple stock portfolio app built using React Native and TypeScript.

# Getting Started

## Step 0: Clone this Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sujayalaspure/stock-portfolio.git
```

## Step 1: Install the Dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

## Step 2: Start the Metro Server

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
yarn start
```

## Step 3: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.
